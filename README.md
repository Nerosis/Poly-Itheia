# Getting Started with Trello!
We use an online software called Trello for team managment purposes and goal setting.

To get started, click this link and create an account (if you don't have one already):

https://trello.com/invite/polyitheia/7b1bde9f514f368a2fbe973ad3a3e721

Once you sucessfully join you should see two boards. Tasks and Goals

Start by clicking on Tasks, you'll see that there are a few "tasks" already put on the board.

***HOW TO USE TRELLO***

Whenever you need something done by another person or team, create a new card by clicking the Add Another Card button at the bottom of a column.

Each Column lists someones name and profession, whenever you need something done by them, add a card and explain what it is! It's that simple.

***For Example***

Let's say I need Ian to make a new enemy for the player to encounter. I would go to trello, add a card saying "Create a new set of sprites for an enemy" or something along those lines. Hit enter, and it's done! I can then choose to click on the card to add a description containing more detail on what I need.

**TIPS**

By clicking and dragging, you can move cards to other columns.

You can add Labels by clicking the card and then Labels. This can be used to give people more info on first glance.

You can also create your own labels by editing a blank one or adding a new one by clicking the "Create a new Label" button at the bottom.
